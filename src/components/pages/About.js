Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? You have to turn them on Morty! The shoes need to be turned on! Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
